# Attendance Monitoring System

A student attendance monitoring system is a software or hardware system used to track and record the attendance of students in a school or educational institution. This can include time-in and time-out. The student attendance monitoring system can be used to ensure compliance with school attendance policies and to track student engagement in the classroom. This system can also be used to monitor student absenteeism and tardiness, which can be early indicators of possible academic or behavioral issues. There are various types of student attendance monitoring systems available, including biometric systems, RFID systems, and software systems that integrate with other student information systems. These systems can be accessed by teachers, administrators, and parents to monitor attendance and to identify patterns of absenteeism.
