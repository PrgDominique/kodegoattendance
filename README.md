These monitoring systems can be accessed by teachers, administrators, and parents to monitor attendance and identify patterns of absenteeism.

>Overall, a student attendance monitoring system is an essential tool for schools and educational institutions to help ensure that students attend classes regularly, engage in their learning, and identify any underlying issues that may impact their academic success.
